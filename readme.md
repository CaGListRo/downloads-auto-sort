# Download Organizer README

## Description:

This Python script organizes files downloaded to a specified directory by moving them into categorized folders based on their file types.

## Usage:

1. Modify the `download_dir` variable to specify the directory where your downloaded files are located.
2. Customize the `folder_names` list to define the names of the folders you want to organize files into.
3. Run the script.

## Example:

Suppose you have files downloaded to the directory 'C:/Users/admin/Downloads/'.
By running the script, files with extensions like .pdf, .exe, .jpg, etc., will be moved into corresponding folders such as 'PDFs', 'Programme', 'Bilder', etc., within the download directory.

## Note:

- Make sure to modify the `download_dir` variable to point to the correct directory where your downloaded files are located.
- Customize the `folder_names` list to match your desired folder structure.
- Ensure that the necessary permissions are granted to the script to perform file operations.
